    "The specifics of the [Method data format](https://brightway2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ia.html#lcia-method-documents) are covered in the `bw2data` documentation, but the basic idea is a key for a biosphere flow, a numeric characterization factor, and a location. Actually, the method data format is pretty flexible, and the following are all acceptable:\n",

The short answer is that there is no single field that uniquely identifies biosphere flows or activities. The longer answer [is in the manual](http://brightway2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/lci.html#uniquely-identifying-datasets)."
