Brightway2 life cycle assessment framework
==========================================

Brightway2 is a open source framework for life cycle assessment (LCA). It is designed to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Brightway2 doesn't try to replace software like SimaPro or OpenLCA, but instead offers possibilities to those who need to go break the limits of conventional LCA. Brightway2 is especially attractive for researchers, especially when used with `IPython notebooks <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_. The core principles of Brightway2 are simplicity, innovation, and power.

Who is Brightway2 for?
----------------------

Brightway2 is for people who want more than is possible with current LCA or sustainability software. Researchers and academics are particularly suitable, because the power that Brightway2 brings is worth the cost of learning a new software and possibly a new language.

A particular weakness of Brightway2 is routine data entry, although there is an active project trying to make this better.

Basically, Brightway2 is for you if your project lies at the intersection of LCA and your imagination.

Understanding the manual
------------------------

.. note:: This manual is `also available as a PDF <http://brightwaylca.org/Brightway2%20manual.pdf>`_.

As this manual covers a lot of material, it can be a bit overwhelming, especially at first. The manual is designed to help you get started in the following order:

* First, :ref:`install Brightway2 <installation>` and its dependencies.
* Second, :ref:`configure Brightway2 <configuration>` by setting a data directory.
* Third, do the :ref:`five tutorials <five-tutorials>`.
* Finally, use the rest of the manual as a reference while creating next-generation LCA studies.

In addition to the main index page and table of contents, in the HTML version you can search the documentation in the box on the left, and look for specific terms in the :ref:`genindex`. There an index at the end of the LaTeX version, but it doesn't get linked correctly for some reason.
