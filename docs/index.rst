Brightway2 life cycle assessment framework
==========================================

Brightway2 is a new framework for life cycle assessment (LCA). Its focus is on efficient calculation and visualization.

Please see `the main Brightway2 site <http://brightwaylca.org>`_ for an introduction.

.. note::
    Brightway2 is currently only compatible with python 2.7, not python 3. Work on Python 3 support is ongoing.

Documentation
=============

Documentation is available on several levels. First, this general documentation gives an overview to the main ideas and structures in Brightway2. The actual code is split into several different :ref:`packages` - e.g data, calculations, analysis, ui - and each package has documentation that gives more specific details on its functions. Finally, there are a set of ipython notebook :ref:`tutorials` and :ref:`examples` that can be read or downloaded and run, and provide more practical advice on applying Brightway2.
