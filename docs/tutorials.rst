Tutorials
=========

There is a tutorial that will take you from a beginner to a Brightway2 pro in five steps. You should read this documentation, and at least be familiar with the specific package documentation, to get the most out of tutorial.

The tutorial notebooks are most effective when downloaded and executed - that is the power of IPython notebooks! Run them, change them, and play around. Learn by making mistakes. Brightway2 allows you to pretty easily delete your data directory and start again.

Examples
========

While the examples are given as IPython notebooks, they might use data sources or computational resources which are not available to everyone, and therefore not all of them can be easily rerun on your local machine.

**This section will be filled in when the example are cleaned up a bit**.
