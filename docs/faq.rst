    * `Notepad ++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_
    * Native editors like gedit or notepad

    * `Spyder <https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/>`_
    * `PyCharm <http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_
    * `PyDev + Eclipse <http://pydev.org/>`_
    * `Komodo <http://www.activestate.com/python-ide>`_

Why Brightway 2?
----------------

Brightway version 1 was a set of programs written during the PhD of Chris Mutel. In the end, there wasn't that much that could be re-used from this research code, other than the name. Brightway2 is a completely new software framework designed to avoid the fate of Brightway version 1.
