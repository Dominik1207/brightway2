Sorry, I don't have such a nice list as Niko right now, but I would say some of the stuff that we put in the activity browser would be very useful for other people as well, such as the "used-by" method or simply to get "human readable" activity data.

A related topic: I know you have once started something with bw2-basic (but don't know much more about it). Standard tasks, like navigation in a database could be put in such a bw2 package so that other, more specific programs could build on that (like the activity browser). For my GUI-browser that I am currently writing I started such a standardTasks class.

Also, if you have some time, I would like to show you the GUI that I made so that we can discuss if and how to integrate it into brightway. Next Tuesday perhaps at 9am?

Cheers
